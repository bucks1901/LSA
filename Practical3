Q.NFS-installation,exports
@nswer....
 Install NFS Kernel Server
Before installing the NFS Kernel server, we need to update our system’s repository index with that of the Internet through the following apt command as sudo:
$ sudo apt-get update

in order to install the NFS Kernel Server on your system:
$ sudo apt-get -y install nfs-kernel-server
$ sudo systemctl enable nfs-kernel-server


 Create the Export
we can create an export directory by the name of “sharedfolder” in our system’s mnt(mount) directory.
By specifying a mount folder name according to your need, through the following command as root:
$ sudo mkdir -p /mnt/sharedfolder

we will remove restrictive permissions of the export folder through the following commands:

$ sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/sharedfolder
$ sudo chmod 777 /mnt/sharedfolder

you can allow access to:

A single client by adding the following line in the file:
/mnt/sharedfolder clientIP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
Multiple clients by adding the following lines in the file:
/mnt/sharedfolder client1IP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
/mnt/sharedfolder client2IP(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
Multiple clients, by specifying an entire subnet that the clients belong to:
/mnt/sharedfolder subnetIP/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
